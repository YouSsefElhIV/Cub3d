# Project Title

Cub3D is a 3D game or rather a 2D game that uses the reycastig concept to transform to a 3D game, which is the Goal of this project in 42 CC.

## Roadmap

1- Start by parsing the .cub file (parse the map, colors, paths, file extension).

2- Put the 2d map first.

3- Build the game controls.

4- Using the DDA algorithm to calculate the distance of the rays.

5- Finally we use that distance we got to put the pixels and the textures.



## Usage/Examples

On 1337 MacOS minilibx already exist so just:

Run: Make && ./executable mapPath (./cub3D maps/map.cub).

on linux or your own machine download minilibx then:

    cd minilibxPath && make
    go to the cub3D header and include "minilibx.h"
    then make.






## Pro Tip:

It would be best to split the Project as follow:

    teammate1: parse map && build the control flow && make the DDA algo.

    teammate2: parse colors && put the textures.
